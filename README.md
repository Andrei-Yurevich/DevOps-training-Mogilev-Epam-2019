### What is there?
This branch shows how to use a docker compose file to build and set up a collectd, influxdb, grafana stack. Just run `docker-compose up -d`.
### Notes
1. If you use virtual machine and "browser" access to db, be sure that ports `8086`,`8083`,`3000` was forwarded (because grafana will works like thin client). In other case it is not necessary.
2. It's  self-service. Set up your dashboard manually.
